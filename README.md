# 🛠️ AWS VPC: Deep Dive and Hands-On Implementation

## 🌐 What is a VPC?

A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It enables you to launch AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, in a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud.

### 🔑 Key Features of VPC:
- **Customizable IP Range** using CIDR blocks.
- Ability to create **public and private subnets**.
- Control over **routing, firewall rules, and NAT**.
- Use of **Internet Gateways**, **NAT Gateways**, and **VPC Peering**.
- Enables secure **communication between instances** within the same or across VPCs.

## ❓ Why Do We Need a VPC?

VPC provides:

- **Network Isolation**: Each VPC is logically isolated from others.
- **Security**: Control traffic with security groups and NACLs.
- **Scalability**: Supports advanced architectures (multi-tier, microservices, etc.).
- **Connectivity**: Securely connect to other VPCs, on-premise data centers, or the internet.

## 🧠 VPC Limitations & Facts

- ✅ You can create **5 VPCs per region** by default (can be increased by AWS support).
- ✅ You can have **200 subnets per VPC**.
- ✅ Each subnet must reside **entirely within one Availability Zone (AZ)**.
- ✅ You can have **one Internet Gateway per VPC**.
- ✅ A VPC spans **all Availability Zones in a region**.
- ✅ **VPC Peering** allows communication between two VPCs.

## 🔧 My Step-by-Step VPC Implementation

### 1️⃣ Create a VPC
1. Go to the **VPC Dashboard** in the AWS console.
2. Click **"Create VPC"**.
3. Choose **VPC Only** option.
4. Enter a **Name** (e.g., `my-vpc`).
5. Set a **CIDR block** (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
6. Enable **DNS hostnames** and **DNS resolution**.
7. Click **Create VPC**.

### 2️⃣ Create Subnets
- **Public Subnet**
  1. Click on **Subnets > Create Subnet**.
  2. Choose your VPC.
  3. Set a **CIDR block** like `10.0.1.0/24`.
  4. Choose an Availability Zone.
  5. Name it `Public Subnet`.

- **Private Subnet**
  1. Repeat the above steps.
  2. Use a different CIDR block (e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`).
  3. Name it `Private Subnet`.

### 3️⃣ Create an Internet Gateway
1. Go to **Internet Gateways**.
2. Click **Create Internet Gateway**.
3. Name it `My-IGW`.
4. Attach it to your VPC.

### 4️⃣ Create a NAT Gateway
1. Go to **Elastic IPs**, allocate a new address.
2. Go to **NAT Gateways** > **Create NAT Gateway**.
3. Select the **Public Subnet** and the allocated Elastic IP.
4. Name it `My-NAT-GW`.

### 5️⃣ Create Route Tables
- **Public Route Table**
  1. Go to **Route Tables** > Create.
  2. Associate it with your VPC.
  3. Add a route: `0.0.0.0/0` → **Internet Gateway**.
  4. Associate with **Public Subnet**.

- **Private Route Table**
  1. Repeat the process.
  2. Add a route: `0.0.0.0/0` → **NAT Gateway**.
  3. Associate with **Private Subnet**.

### 6️⃣ Launch EC2 Instances
- Launch an instance in the **Public Subnet** (with public IP enabled).
- Launch another in the **Private Subnet** (without public IP).
- Use SSH or EC2 Connect to test connectivity.

## 🔄 VPC Peering (Connect Two VPCs)

### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **VPC Dashboard > Peering Connections**.
2. Click **Create Peering Connection**.
3. Select **Requester VPC** and **Accepter VPC** (can be in same or different accounts).
4. Click **Create Peering Connection**.
5. Go to **Peering Connection**, select it, and click **Accept**.

### Update Route Tables:

- In **Requester VPC** Route Table:
  - Add route to **Accepter CIDR block** → **Peering Connection**.

- In **Accepter VPC** Route Table:
  - Add route to **Requester CIDR block** → **Peering Connection**.

### Optional:
- Update **Security Groups** to allow traffic between instances in both VPCs.

## 🧠 Summary: What I Learned
- VPC is the backbone of cloud networking in AWS.
- Understanding CIDR blocks, routing, and gateways is essential.
- Proper subnetting helps isolate workloads.
- NAT vs Internet Gateway defines access scope.
- VPC Peering allows secure cross-VPC communication.
